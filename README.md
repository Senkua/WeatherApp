# <Weather Application>

## Description

- My motivation for this was to provide a streamline way for anyone to find out the info they need about the weather for their city, and a forecast as well!
- I built this project to further my understanding of third party Api's and to improve my knowledge of local storage.
- This will help anyone see the weather when needed.
- I learnt a lot more about the api keys and about local storage, as well as more logic.
